# COMP2110 Group-36 Report
Ryan Roy, Mingyou Han, Julian Varga

Details of your deployment and where your application can be accessed (URL).

What you achieved: a short (few paragraphs) description of what your group has implemented; highlight any extensions or additional work you did.


What did you find challenging: tell us what was hard about completing the project. This might be technical (understanding the API) or organisational (communication within the group). 


What was rewarding: one or two things that you were able to do that you feel contributed to your understanding of the content of this unit.


Individual reflection: each team member should write one paragraph on their personal experience (include your name):
- which widget did you choose and why?
- what was the most challenging part of the project for you?
